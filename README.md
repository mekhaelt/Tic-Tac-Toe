# Tic-Tac-Toe
This program uses Java and JavaAWT to create a functional game of Tic Tac Toe. Object-oriented programming is used to create a Tic Tac Toe space object with different attributes based on if the space contains an 'x', 'o', or if it is blank.

A Tic Tac Toe board object is created and given the Tic Tac Toe space attribute. Manipulation of 1-D & 2-D arrays is used create the layout for the board and create the logic for the game. It prevents any errors from occurring (ie. placing an x on top of an already placed o), creates the condition for winning the game (get 3 of your symbols in a row), and creates the condition for a tie (when no win has taken place and no more empty spaces are available).

Java AWT creates the graphical interface for the board: it sets up the colour scheme, the fonts of all the characters, the size of all the buttons and more.
